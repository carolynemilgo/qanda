  "notes":"War for the Planet of the Apes” is a film that unapologetically embraces the first word of its title. It opens with soldiers in a lush green forest with nicknames on their helmets, marching toward the enemy through the brush in a style that reminded me of “Platoon.” Over the next two hours, other war films will flash through your mind, most commonly “Apocalypse Now,” which Matt Reeves’ excellent blockbuster cribs from openly, even turning its villain into a Colonel Kurtz in the heart of darkness, complete with shaved head and rambling philosophy. (At one point, graffiti even reads “Ape-pocalypse Now,” as if to make clear that Reeves and company aren’t stealing as much as directly paying homage.) So why turn a franchise about sentient apes into a war movie that echoes the stories of Vietnam? What can be gained from looking at the darkest side of humanity through the lens of a summer blockbuster? The answer is quite a lot.How do I convince viewers who may be reluctant to see a movie about talking apes that these three movies have transcended their concept to become one of the best Hollywood trilogies of their generation?",

  "notes":"And yes, Borough Market is shinier and tidier than when it first emerged as a beacon for greedy people in the 1990s. But it’s still a glorious place. If it was in Florence or Barcelona, British food tourists would rave about it, but because it’s in London some of them work hard to sneer. Compared to Barcelona’s Boqueria, cluttered now with tawdry stalls flogging over-priced fruit slushies to tourists, Borough is a bastion of taste and commitment.And it hasn’t stopped attracting the good stuff. Six months ago, Sam and Eddie Hart, the brothers behind both Quo Vadis and the brilliant Barrafina group of tapas restaurants, helped open a taqueria here called El Pastór. They’re not allowed to say it’s in Borough Market, because it’s on the other side of Stoney Street, but if you lobbed a rare-breed pork chop from under the market’s canopy you could easily get it through the entrance to their renovated railway arch.",
